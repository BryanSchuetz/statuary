A bronze bust by Galvarino Ponce Morel of Bernardo O'Higgins placed outside of the Chilean Embassy.

Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme was a Chilean independence leader who freed Chile from Spanish rule in the Chilean War of Independence. He was a wealthy landowner of Spanish and Irish ancestry. Although he was the second Supreme Director of Chile (1817â€“1823), he is considered one of Chile's founding fathers, as he was the first holder of this title to head a fully independent Chilean state.
