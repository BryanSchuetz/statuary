Commissioned in May 1847, cast in 1852, and dedicated on January 8, 1853, by Stephen A. Douglas. It was the first equestrian statue made in America. Jackson's horse at the Battle of New Orleans was named Duke; but Mills modeled the horse from his own horse named Olympus. Mills trained his horse to pose on its haunches. He completed a plaster model, and started a foundry to produce the casting. He produced six castings until the final one was completed, with ten pieces.

Andrew Jackson was an American soldier and statesman who served as the seventh President of the United States from 1829 to 1837. Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States Army and served in both houses of Congress. As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the "common man" against a "corrupt aristocracy" and to preserve the Union.
