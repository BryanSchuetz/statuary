This statue of the Crown Princess Martha Thyra by Kristen Kokkin was installed in front of the Norweigen Embassy in 2005.

Princess Martha left Norway with her three children before the outbreak of WWII, and found her way to Washington D.C. where she remained for the duration of the war—returning to Norway in 1945.
