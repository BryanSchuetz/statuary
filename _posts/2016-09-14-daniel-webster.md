A statue honoring U.S. statesman Daniel Webster. It's located near Webster's former home at 1603 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest. The statue was given to the United States government by Stilson Hutchins, founder of the Washington Post and a fellow native of New Hampshire. The memorial was dedicated on January 19, 1900.

Daniel Webster was an American politician who twice served in the United States House of Representatives, representing New Hampshire (1813–1817) and Massachusetts (1823–1827), served as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts (1827–1841 and 1845–1850) and was twice the United States Secretary of State, under Presidents William Henry Harrison and John Tyler (1841–1843) and Millard Fillmore (1850–1852). He and James G. Blaine were the only two people to serve as Secretary of State under three presidents. Webster also sought the Whig Party nomination for President three times: in 1836, 1840 and 1852.
