The original was unearthed in 1959 in Athens, this copy was presented as a present from the citizens of Greece to the people of the United States of America in 1991.

Melpomene "to sing" or "the one that is melodious", initially the Muse of Chorus, she then became the Muse of Tragedy, for which she is best known now. Her name was derived from the Greek verb melp√¥ or melpomai meaning "to celebrate with dance and song." She is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the cothurnus, boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. Often, she also holds a knife or club in one hand and the tragic mask in the other.
