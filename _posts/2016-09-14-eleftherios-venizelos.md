An outdoor sculpture of Eleftherios Venizelos, installed outside the Embassy of Greece, on Massachusetts Avenue between Sheridan Circle and 22nd Street, NW, in Embassy Row. It was erected by the Hellenic Parliament in 2009.

Eleftherios Kyriakou Venizelos was an eminent Greek leader of the Greek national liberation movement and a charismatic statesman of the early 20th century remembered for his promotion of liberal-democratic policies. As leader of the Liberal Party, he was elected several times as Prime Minister of Greece, serving from 1910 to 1920 and from 1928 to 1933. Venizelos had such profound influence on the internal and external affairs of Greece that he is credited with being "the maker of modern Greece", and is still widely known as the "Ethnarch".
