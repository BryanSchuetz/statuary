This statue, by William McVey (1902-1995), was erected in 1966 by public subscription, on the initiative of the English Speaking Union. One foot stands on United States soil, one on the British Embassy grounds: a symbol of Churchill's Anglo-American descent, and of the Alliance he did so much to forge, in war and peace.

Winston Churchill was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940-1945. He also served as the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the Minister of Defence. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953 for his historical series on World War II.
