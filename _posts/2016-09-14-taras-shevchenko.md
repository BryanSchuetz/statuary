This memorial is a bronze statue and stone relief-adorned wall located in Dupont Circle. It is one of many monuments in Washington, D.C. which honor foreign heroes who symbolize freedom in their native countries. The memorial honors Taras Shevchenko (1814â€“1861), a Ukrainian poet and artist who influenced the development of modern Ukrainian literature.

Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure, as well as folklorist and ethnographer. His literary heritage is regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian language. Shevchenko is also known for many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator.
