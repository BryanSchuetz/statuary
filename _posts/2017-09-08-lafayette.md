Cast in 1890, and installed in April 1891—this statue of Major General Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette was erected in the public square that bares his name by Jean Alexandre Joseph Falguiere.

Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, in the United States often known simply as Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War. A close friend of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson, Lafayette was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830.
