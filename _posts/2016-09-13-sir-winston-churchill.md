This statue, by William McVey (1902-1995), was erected in 1966 by public subscription, on the initiative of the English Speaking Union. One foot stands on United States soil, one on the British Embassy grounds: a symbol of Churchill's Anglo-American descent, and of the Alliance he did so much to forge, in war and peace.

Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, was a British politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. As Prime Minister, Churchill led Britain to victory over Nazi Germany during World War II. Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a non-academic historian, and a writer, the fact that won him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 for his overall, lifetime body of work.
